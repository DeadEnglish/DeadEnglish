**`Senior Web Developer | Digital Creative | Terrible Gamer `**

Hi, I'm Liam! A senior web developer who predominantly works with frontend technologies but I've got my fingers in the full-stack pie. From start to finish all personal projects are planned, designed and built from the ground up (even if it means a few unfinished kanban boards). If I'm not thinking of a new project, you'll probably find me playing with my border collie or playing games at a less-than-average level.

  <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª How it all started</h3></summary>
  As a teenager I was always interested in computers, from playing games to learning how to write silly scripts to open disc trays, I was always looking into how things worked but it soon grew into fiddling with computer hardware and making useful scripts to help with productivity. I didn't plan on going into technology or development, it was just something I did for fun. After pursuing media and filmmaking for a few years, I ended up doing an apprenticeship in IT. I learned how to build, create and develop in a somewhat real environment but the job that went along with the apprenticeship was a QA tester (no shade to QA, it's just not for me). I took everything I learned from the apprenticeship and built a website for a Facebook group that wanted to expand its online presence. Using that and a few other projects as a portfolio, I landed my first job as a Junior web developer and it's been a hell of a ride since. Being self-taught I've always had to learn fast to make sure I'm on top of my game, I've never really kicked the habit so I'm always on the lookout to learn something new or build something using technology I haven't before. I'm coming up to almost 8 years as a web developer and I feel like I'm only just scratching the surface!
